<!-- 
Summary of the Code:
- The structure of this HTML document includes the basic elements like <head> and <body>.
- In the <head> section, meta tags are used to specify character encoding (UTF-8) and ensure responsiveness with the viewport meta tag.
- Several navigation links are created using the <a> tag, leading to various pages (sign-up, about, etc.).
- An image is embedded using the <img> tag, and the image is centered using the deprecated <center> tag.
- The <h1> and <h3> heading tags are used to create text headings, and a button element (<button>) is included for sign-up functionality (but it doesnâ€™t link anywhere yet).

*******************Key Points:------------------
Links and Navigation: All the anchor tags <a> are navigation links. Some of them (like Products, Pricing, and Support) point to the signup page. You might want to update them to the correct URLs.
Centering: The <center> tag is used to center elements on the page. Although it's effective here, it's considered deprecated in HTML5. You could achieve the same effect using CSS (text-align: center;).
Image: Make sure the image file path /Week-1/01_html/landing.png is correct. Otherwise, the image won't display.
Button: The button is for signing up, but as a standalone HTML button, it doesn't yet perform any action (e.g., linking to a sign-up form). If you want it to navigate somewhere, you can wrap it in an anchor tag or add JavaScript functionality later.
